# vimrc
My latest vimrc it includes [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) configurations for:
* YouCompleteMe
* Ultisnippets
* Supertab

This vimrc is in most cases not sutable for server environments as it integrates YouCompleteMe.

.gitigrone assumes you clone this in ~/.vim and set a link with:
```bash
ln -s ~/.vim/.vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
