# vimrc
My latest vimrc it includes [vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) configurations for:
* YouCompleteMe
* Ultisnippets
* Supertab

**Note:** This vimrc is in most cases not sutable for server environments as it uses YouCompleteMe.

## Setup
```bash
cd ~/.vim
git clone https://github.com/JanoschDeurer/vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc/.vimrc ~/vimrc
```
